The Smart Parking Finder app is a web-based application that simulates a real-time parking lot management system. Here's a brief overview of its features and functionality:

1. Visual Representation: The app displays a grid of parking spots, each represented by a colored square with an icon:

1. Green (🅿️): Available spots
2. Yellow (🚗): Reserved spots
3. Red (🚙): Occupied spots



2. Real-time Updates: The parking lot status updates every 30 seconds, simulating cars arriving and leaving.
3. Reservation System: Users can reserve available spots by clicking on them and entering their email address.
4. Cancellation: Users can cancel their own reservations, but not those made by others.
5. Dynamic Occupancy: The app simulates cars occupying reserved spots over time.
6. User Interaction:

1. Hover effects on parking spots for better visibility
2. Tooltips showing spot status and reservation details
3. A form for entering email when reserving a spot



7. Responsive Design: The layout adjusts based on screen size for optimal viewing on various devices.
8. Manual Simulation: Users can trigger an immediate occupancy simulation using a button.
9. Clear Visual Feedback: The app provides status messages for actions like reservations and cancellations.
10. Legend: A color-coded legend explains the meaning of each spot color.


This app demonstrates key concepts in React development, including state management, server actions (simulated backend), responsive design, and real-time updates. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing and viewing parking spot availability in a dynamic environment.
